- Refine the zooming. I think that the game feeling is better when you can see the whole fighting, not just a small square, so I increased the zoom out max value and fixed the zoom in to be to the mouse location
- Added bomb animation and die animation to the infantry units - they are kamikaze
- Added spawn buildings and proper Z index for the enemies
- TODO utilize the bottom line - enemies to go through there
